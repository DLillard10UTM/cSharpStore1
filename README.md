 Design Choices:
 
  The Good:
    C# is a cool language with much more functionality than C++, I am excited to learn about it through trial and error.
    Parent and child classes make more sense now.
    I believe my menu gives the user pretty *good* feedback based on what they are doing.
    
  The Bad:
    My derived class functions work, but I do not think I actually overrode any functions.
    Each class is in one super file, which I believe is ok for the first project but will not be a habit.
